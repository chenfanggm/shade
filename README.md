# Shade

Shade is a WebGL 3d graphics engine. Right now it is just an experiment to get to know WebGL and play around with engine architecture. In the future it might grow into something useful for others.

Shades cares deeply about simplicity, so its core philosphy is to keep things straight-forward and simple. You should be able to explore the code and not feel overwhelmed at the complexity. 3d engines tends to be complicated, but it hopes to fight that and still keep good performance.

It offers a scene graph and renderer which optimally sorts and renders 3d objects, and a few other essential items. It hopes to not grow beyond this essentially scope, while offering other rich features in the form of plugins.
